# Flapwii Bird

Flapwii Bird is a recreation for the Wii of the viral hit [*Flappy Bird*](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). It's designed for use with the
[Homebrew Channel](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel). While not an
exact clone, the game captures the fun and addictively frustrating nature
of the classic gameplay loop. It offers a deceptively simple experience that
functionally mirrors the original's 2011 mechanics.

## About This Version

This is a fork of the original [Flapwii Bird](https://github.com/TheBlueOompaLoompa/flapwii-bird)
by [TheBlueOompaLoompa](https://github.com/TheBlueOompaLoompa). The original was
written over the course of 24 hours as a way to rediscover the homebrew scene
and stands as a testament to the creator's goal to "give it a good try and
actually succeed" at Wii development. The goal of this continuation fork is to
modernize the codebase and continue development with new features and fully
open source assets.
